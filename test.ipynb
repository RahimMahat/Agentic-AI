       "First, what is moral absolutes versus moral relativism? Moral absolutes mean that everyone should act in accordance with the law or code of ethics, based on universal human nature. So if you're following a set of rules, it doesn't matter who you are; your actions would be right as long as they align within those standards.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the other hand, moral relativism implies that our behavior is relative to what others expect us to do. Our values can vary across different communities or societies even though we abide by their laws.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, Sartre talks about existentialism, which considers human identity beyond just physical traits. He posits that humans are free to imagine characters and develop identities not confined by nature.\n",
       "\n",
       "So why does moral absolutism contradict with existentialist ideas? Well, on one hand, existentialists see potential for individuality—like a being able to take different paths or have unique qualities beyond biological constraints. On the other hand, when we impose laws or codes blindly based on natural principles, it limits expression.\n",
       "\n",
       "But then I wonder, aren't existentialist views about identity more tied to the idea of free will and the potential for becoming? Like, even if you follow societal norms, within those, you can choose your own path. That seems to conflict with absolute moral laws where following rules everywhere would override personal choices.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, so maybe when we apply strict laws or codes blindly, it limits us emotionally, intellectually, or morally based on what society tells us rather than trusting our inner strength and identity as individual. In contrast, existentialists think that people can imagine ways they like to find meaning in the world, which Sartre sees as a kind of freedom.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, does this mean that while there are universal and shared principles (like laws), the actual expression of those through action is relative? It's not just about following rules but expressing individuality too. That could be a contradiction because it forces individuals to live according to societal norms instead of finding their own paths, even if they want uniqueness.\n",
       "\n",
       "Also, in legal and social contexts, people often follow certain moral absolutes blindly without questioning them. But existentialists might see that human identity is multifaceted, allowing for personal choices beyond the laws imposed by society. So it's a contradiction where we're too rigid with our ethics versus allowing individual agency in what we do.\n",
       "\n",
       "I think that makes sense. They are contradictory in how they approach ethical expression—universal truths vs. individual expressions of those truths.

       "In cultural contexts, many values, like the Golden Rule, tie human actions to social laws, which seems in line with a society that might have some universal morality but conflicting with existentialist ideas about personal meaning. But if ethics are universally applied without considering individual differences, this could clash or create issues where people might act according to societal rules rather than their core values. So moral absolutism can be contradictory here.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the other hand, in certain legal and social contexts, like criminal justice, we do apply laws based on universal rules. This shows that while there's a need for personal values, existing regulations can reinforce those by enforcing universal behaviors. Thus, moral absolutism doesn't contradict social contexts but still holds its value there too.\n",
       "\n",
       "I should also consider how identity plays a role here: existentialists argue about the nature of being and belonging, whereas mere application of laws or sanctions could validate that notion by holding onto fundamental ways people're defined externally.\n",
       "</think>\n",
       "\n",
       "In many cultures and philosophies, moral absolutism is often contrasted with the complex concept of human identity as perceived by existentialist theorists like Jean-Paul Sartre. While on one hand, traditional ethical systems may uphold universal moral standards through laws (moral absolutism), on the other hand, existentialism questions the universality of moral truths and emphasizes the subjective identity and personal meaning behind such laws. This duality can lead to contradiction when considering both cultural interpretations of ethics and existentialist views on how individuals are defined.\n",
       "\n",
       "### On the One Hand:\n",
       "**Moral Abolutism in Cultural Interpretation:**\n",
       "In many societies, particular ethical systems (e.g., the Golden Rule) emphasize moral laws that are universally applied without exception. This sense of moral universality can create a contradiction when combined with existentialist views on human identity. Sartre's existence is about self-creation through non-identical parents but insists on individual autonomy. Thus, existing universal norms may clash with existential interpretations of the meaning of those norms.\n",
       "\n",
       "### On the Other Hand:\n",
       "In legal and social contexts, laws (like criminal justice) typically function by enforcing universal moral principles that enforce their application even while acknowledging the subjective identity of individuals. Many crimes are justifiable based on societal criteria rather than individual values. This shows that at least some universal laws can coexist with existentialist notions of individual agency.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion:\n",
       "The clash between ethical absolutes and existentialist views occurs in interpretive contexts where some argue ethics should be personal while others emphasize objective universal truths. Sartre and such theories help provide critical frameworks for understanding how these dualities manifest and interact, highlighting that neither is inherently contradictory but rather co-existing within different theoretical perspectives."

      "First, what is moral absolutes versus moral relativism? Moral absolutes mean that everyone should act in accordance with the law or code of ethics, based on universal human nature. So if you're following a set of rules, it doesn't matter who you are; your actions would be right as long as they align within those standards.\n",

      "So why does moral absolutism contradict with existentialist ideas? Well, on one hand, existentialists see potential for individuality—like a being able to take different paths or have unique qualities beyond biological constraints. On the other hand, when we impose laws or codes blindly based on natural principles, it limits expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then I wonder, aren't existentialist views about identity more tied to the idea of free will and the potential for becoming? Like, even if you follow societal norms, within those, you can choose your own path. That seems to conflict with absolute moral laws where following rules everywhere would override personal choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, so maybe when we apply strict laws or codes blindly, it limits us emotionally, intellectually, or morally based on what society tells us rather than trusting our inner strength and identity as individual. In contrast, existentialists think that people can imagine ways they like to find meaning in the world, which Sartre sees as a kind of freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, does this mean that while there are universal and shared principles (like laws), the actual expression of those through action is relative? It's not just about following rules but expressing individuality too.
